			<h1>How can executable specifications and living documentation be used for stakeholder collaboration? </h1>

			

<p>A while back while I was still trialing this framework I received an enormous JIRA ticket
describing the complex logic flows and behavior of a command line application.</p>

<p>This was bad enough The worst part, though, was that I actually didn&rsquo;t <em>really</em>
understand what I was building.</p>

<h2 id="collaborating-with-an-executable-specification">Collaborating with an executable specification</h2>

<p>Gradually I turned those descriptions in to an executable specification that described how
the command line tool was supposed to behave. That meant writing a series of YAML stories
that said &ldquo;if the app was run with abc parameters then it should do xyz, etc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I built executable hitchstory specs that I thought described about
90% what the product manager wanted - there were still critical pieces missing.</p>

<p>The translation process was not easy because the Jira ticket was often vague
because the descriptions were sometimes vague, always complicated and
occasionally missing key nuggets of information.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;magic&rdquo; happened when I showed the YAML specifications to him. He was instantly able
to identify the behavior I had inferred from his JIRA ticket and not only
the correct the mistakes that I&rsquo;d made interpreting him, but also mistakes <em>he&rsquo;d</em> made
<em>writing</em> the ticket - just by looking over my shoulder.</p>

<p>At the same time as correcting my mistakes I tried noting down metadata
<a href="../../using/alpha/metadata">alongside the stories</a> - about <em>why</em> the behavior
was as it was although due to time pressures I never really did figure it out
and document it.</p>

<h2 id="writing-the-code">Writing the code</h2>

<p>As I wrote the specifications and implemented the code new scenarios that weren&rsquo;t
obvious before suddenly became obvious. Each time either asked him what the behavior
should be and wrote it up or just wrote it up (if it seemed fairly obvious).</p>

<p>Whether it was obvious or not, however, I still circled round and double checked
the desired behavior with executable stories precisely because what I thought was
obvious could have been wrong and what I heard verbally or via chat I might not have
interpreted accurately.</p>

<p>Indeed, this was exactly the case - I did misinterpret him and I did make faulty
assumptions.</p>

<p>In all cases, having a highly specific spec following the <a href="../screenplay-principle">screenplay principle</a>
to refer to gave us both the confidence that I was building the right thing.</p>

<h2 id="wherein-the-code-rewrites-the-story">Wherein the code rewrites the story</h2>

<p>Since it was a command line application I was building, the nature of the
stories followed a basic pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run command with parameters a, b, c</li>
<li>The command calls a mock database (and the call needs to be verified).</li>
<li>The command outputs on to the screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I could have done the strictest form of TDD where I wrote the test/spec
first <em>always</em> and then wrote the code that made it pass.</p>

<p>Instead, I opted for a looser approach. I wrote the basic outline of the
test first, <em>then</em> I wrote the code and <em>then</em> I ran the test in <a href="../using/alpha/rewrite-story">rewrite
mode</a> so that whatever the command line output
was, that was written directly in to the story automatically if the rest of
the scenario didn&rsquo;t fail.</p>

<p>Then I reloaded the story in the text editor and eyeballed it to see that it
looked correct.</p>

<p><em>Then</em> I circled back to the product owner and verified that the whole story
looked correct together.</p>

<p>This had all of the benefit of test driven development except it cut the
amount of time required to write the story in half.</p>

<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>

<p>QA picked up bugs afterwards when integration testing, but surprisingly,
they were all either mistakes the product manager had made himself or
environment issues. The logic of the program wasn&rsquo;t extremely complicated
so this wasn&rsquo;t a gratitously monumental achievment but it was still cool.</p>

<p>The <em>shocking</em> part was that by using hitchstory and following the process of
iterating jointly with the product manager I managed to build an entire software
system with the <em>barest</em> domain knowledge and no real understanding of why it did
what it did.</p>

<p>And it worked.</p>

<p>And I still don&rsquo;t really understand why it did what it did.</p>
