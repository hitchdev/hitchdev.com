      <description>ALPHA CHANGES (e.g. 0.1.0 -&amp;gt; 0.1.1)
This program will probably have everything about it changed.
BETA CHANGES (e.g. 0.1.0 -&amp;gt; 0.2.0)
The program is in BETA and is in a state where it is ready for dogfooding.
The chances are, if you ask for support on a beta program I will give a lot of it, and freely. In return, you let me know what issues you found.
0.1.5 -&amp;gt; 0.</description>

Hitch libraries are developed and tested with the hitch framework. It probably won&amp;rsquo;t be familiar to you, but it should have a number of other advantages that other testing/specification frameworks don&amp;rsquo;t, including automated dev environment setup.
Below is a step by step guide to get started:
Mac set up prerequisites To run integration tests / environment on a Mac, you need to first ensure that brew is installed (note that this will require XCode from the Mac App store is installed, and, subsequently, that &amp;ldquo;xcode-select &amp;ndash;install&amp;rdquo; is run).</description>
